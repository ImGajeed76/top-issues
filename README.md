A simple GitHub Action that automatically ranks open feature request issues in your repository based on üëç reactions and
generates a Markdown file listing them.

---

## ü§î What it Does

This action runs on a schedule (or manually) to:

1. Find all **open** issues in your repository with a specific label (e.g., `feature-request`).
2. Count the number of üëç (thumbs up) reactions on each of those issues.
3. Sort the issues in descending order based on the reaction count.
4. Generate (or update) a Markdown file (e.g., `RANKED_FEATURES.md`) in your repository listing the ranked issues with
   links.

## üéâ Why Use It?

* **Automated Prioritization:** Get a quick, data-driven overview of what features your community is most interested in.
* **Improved Visibility:** Provides an easy-to-read list for maintainers and contributors.
* **Simple Setup:** Just add two files to your repository.
* **Free & Integrated:** Runs directly within GitHub using GitHub Actions (free for public repos).
* **No External Services:** Keeps everything within your GitHub repository.

## üìä Example Output

The action will generate a file (e.g., `RANKED_FEATURES.md`) that looks something like this:

Here's a static example of what the generated Markdown content looks like:

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Setting this up in your repository is easy:

1. **Create Workflow Directory:**
   If it doesn't exist, create the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your repository.

2. **Copy Workflow File:**
   Copy the contents of [`.github/workflows/rank-features.yml`](./.github/workflows/rank-features.yml) from *this*
   repository into a new file named `rank-features.yml` inside *your* repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.

3. **Create Scripts Directory:**
   If it doesn't exist, create the `.github/scripts` directory in the root of your repository.

4. **Copy Script File:**
   Copy the contents of [`.github/scripts/rank_issues.ts`](./.github/scripts/rank_issues.ts) from *this* repository into
   a new file named `rank_issues.ts` inside *your* repository's `.github/scripts/` directory.

5. **Customize (Optional):**
   Open *your* `.github/workflows/rank-features.yml` file and adjust the following settings if needed:

    * **Schedule:** The default schedule runs the action daily at midnight UTC. You can change the `cron` schedule under
      `on:` to run more or less frequently.
        * Default: `cron: '0 0 * * *'` (Daily at 00:00 UTC)
        *
        See [Cron Schedule Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule)
        for more options.
    * **Label:** Change the `FEATURE_LABEL` environment variable under `env:` if you use a different label for feature
      requests (e.g., `enhancement`).
    * **Output File:** Change the `OUTPUT_FILE` environment variable if you want to name the generated Markdown file
      differently or place it elsewhere.
    * **Commit Branch:** By default, the action commits to your repository's default branch. If you want to commit to a
      different branch (like `gh-pages`), add a `COMMIT_BRANCH` environment variable under `env:`.
    * **Commit Message:** Change the `COMMIT_MESSAGE` environment variable for a custom commit message.

6. **Commit & Push:**
   Commit these two new files (`.github/workflows/rank-features.yml` and `.github/scripts/rank_issues.ts`) to your
   repository.

That's it! The action will run on the next scheduled time (daily at midnight UTC by default) or you can trigger it
manually from the "Actions" tab in your repository (look for "Rank Feature Requests").

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options (in `rank-features.yml`)

You can customize the action's behavior by modifying the `env:` section within your
`.github/workflows/rank-features.yml` file:

* `FEATURE_LABEL`: (Required) The label used to identify feature request issues.
* Default: `feature-request`
* `OUTPUT_FILE`: (Required) The path (relative to the repo root) where the Markdown report will be saved.
* Default: `RANKED_FEATURES.md`
* `COMMIT_MESSAGE`: (Optional) The commit message used when updating the report file.
* Default: `Update ranked features list`
* `COMMIT_BRANCH`: (Optional) The branch to commit the report file to. If not set, uses the repository's default branch.
* Example: `gh-pages`
